# Josip Huzovic â€“ Cybersecurity & IT Portfolio

I'm Josip, a cybersecurity graduate focused on building and testing real-world attack and defense scenarios. Projects range from USB-based ransomware simulations to SIEM tuning and log correlation inside enterprise-style virtual labs.

Everything here was built for educational and demonstrative purposes, and tested safely in isolated virtual labs.

## Projects

### [Homelab: Network Defense & SIEM Tuning](./Homelab%20Project)
This lab simulates internal reconnaissance, attack execution, and blue team response using Splunk, pfSense, and a segmented network of VMs.
- Simulated attack paths using Nmap, Metasploit, and reverse shells
- Configured pfSense to segment network traffic and control inbound exploitation attempts
- Ingested `.zsh_history` and synthetic logs into Splunk for near-real-time detection
- Documented incident response flow based on triggered alerts and manual correlation

### [Malware Simulation: USB-Based Cross-Platform Ransomware](./Malware%20USB%20Simulation)
Simulated real-world ransomware behavior using a Bash Bunny Mark II USB emulation device, with OS-aware logic and ethical recovery workflows. Includes a full-featured Linux payload developed using Ducky Script, GPG-based encryption, and systemd-based persistence.
- Payload detects OS (Windows or Linux) and adjusts attack strategy accordingly
- Designed for AV evasion and privilege-aware execution using PowerShell and terminal-based delivery
- Includes full recovery script and test validation procedures
- Built and tested in VMware-based sandbox environments
- Awarded 2nd Place at the 2024 Mid-Hudson Valley TechMeet for innovation and safe malware handling
