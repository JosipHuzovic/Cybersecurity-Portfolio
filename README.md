# Josip Huzovic â€“ Cybersecurity & IT Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Josip, a cybersecurity graduate passionate about system defense, incident response, and practical, lab-based learning. This portfolio showcases my hands-on projects, from malware simulation to homelab network defense, all developed in controlled environments to reflect real-world challenges.

Everything here was built for educational and demonstrative purposes, and tested safely in isolated virtual labs.

## Projects

### [Homelab: Network Defense & SIEM Tuning](./homelab)
A self-hosted virtual lab built to simulate enterprise-grade IT operations and defensive security.
- Built and managed a virtualized lab using VMware with Windows/Linux hosts
- Configured pfSense firewall, Wireshark, and Splunk for network inspection and log monitoring
- Simulated system issues and resolved support ticket scenarios in a sandboxed environment

### [Malware Simulation: USB-Based Cross-Platform Ransomware](./malware-simulation)
Capstone project exploring malware behavior and endpoint defense bypass via USB emulation.
- Developed a cross-platform ransomware simulation utilizing the Bash Bunny Mark II along with Python, PowerShell, and terminal-based execution to support behavioral analysis
- Used a Bash Bunny Mark II USB emulation tool to test endpoint defense and privilege handling
- Awarded 2nd Place at the 2024 Mid-Hudson Valley TechMeet for innovation and safe malware handling
