# Personal Homelab Project
This self-hosted lab simulates enterprise systems using virtual machines, firewall segmentation, and network monitoring tools to build hands-on experience in IT support, diagnostics, and incident response workflows.

---
## Skills Demonstrated
- Network Scanning & Reconnaissance
- Vulnerability Identification & Exploitation
- Log Analysis & SIEM Tuning
- Firewall Configuration & Segmentation
- Incident Response Documentation

---
## Setup
- VMware Workstation
- Hosts: Kali Linux & Metasploitable2

---
## Tools Used
- Wireshark for packet inspection and troubleshooting
- Splunk for log monitoring and simulated ticket triage
- pfSense for firewall policy and subnet segmentation

---
## Scenarios Practiced
- **Discovered and profiled live hosts** using `nmap` and `ifconfig` to map internal network topology
- **Enumerated open ports and services** with `nmap -sV` to identify potential attack vectors
- **Simulated brute-force login attempts** on vulnerable services (e.g., Telnet, SSH)
- **Captured network traffic** using Wireshark to analyze reconnaissance activity and reverse shell payloads
- **Tested Splunk SIEM ingestion** by generating synthetic logs and manually uploading system logs for event correlation
- **Executed basic privilege escalation scenarios** using Metasploit modules and post-exploitation tools (sandboxed)
- **Configured pfSense firewall rules** to segment networks and observe blocked vs. allowed traffic patterns
- **Documented incident response workflows** based on Splunk alerting and log search queries

---
## Key Takeaways
- Gained hands-on experience with log analysis, troubleshooting, and user/system behavior
- Learned to simulate real-world IT support cases using controlled environments
