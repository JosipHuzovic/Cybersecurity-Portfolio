# Josip Huzovic â€“ Homelab Project

This self-hosted lab simulates enterprise systems using virtual machines, firewalls, and network monitoring tools to gain experience in IT support, diagnostics, and incident response workflows.

##Setup
- VirtualBox and VMware Workstation
- Hosts: Windows 10 VM, Kali Linux, Metasploitable2
- pfSense firewall configured for internal traffic monitoring

##Tools Used
- Wireshark for packet inspection and troubleshooting
- Splunk for log monitoring and simulated ticket triage
- pfSense for firewall policy and subnet segmentation

##Scenarios Practiced
- Diagnosed simulated DNS issues and port blocks
- Resolved scripted service failures
- Captured and analyzed traffic for malicious indicators

##Key Takeaways
- Gained hands-on experience with log analysis, troubleshooting, and user/system behavior
- Learned to simulate real-world IT support cases using controlled environments

##Project Roadmap & Goals

This lab is an evolving project designed to simulate key elements of a real-world IT and cybersecurity environment. Below is a snapshot of tracked tasks and planned scenarios, prioritized by importance.
