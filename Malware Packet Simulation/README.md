# Malware Packet Simulation: Simulated Malware Beaconing for Wireshark Analysis



This project simulates an extremely simple malware-like “beaconing” behavior by sending repeated network packets to a designated IP and port. The goal is to demonstrate how malicious traffic patterns can be identified in a packet sniffer like Wireshark, without deploying any harmful code.



The script generates harmless UDP traffic at regular intervals, mimicking the way real malware communicates with a command-and-control server. When captured and analyzed, the traffic creates recognizable signatures (such as consistent timing, repeated payloads, and unusual port usage) which can then be flagged as suspicious activity during network monitoring or threat hunting.

## Educational Purpose

This simulation is built for **educational and demonstrative use only**. It provides a safe way to:



- Practice detecting beaconing traffic with Wireshark filters

- Explore how attackers use repetitive patterns to maintain persistence

- Build intuition for differentiating between normal web traffic and potential indicators of compromise



All testing should be conducted in isolated or controlled environments. No sensitive or external systems are targeted.
