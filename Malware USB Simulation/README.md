# Capstone: Malware Simulation & Response Planning

Designed and tested a simulated cross-platform ransomware payload to study malware behavior, endpoint defenses, and mitigation strategies in sandboxed environments.
  
This simulation was built solely for demonstrative and educational purposes, utilizing keyboard impersonation (via the Bash Bunny) to inject commands into host systems and initiate a ransomware-like state on both Linux and Windows platforms.

## Technologies Used
- Python and PowerShell scripting
- Linux & Windows sandboxed VMs
- Bash Bunny Mark II (USB emulation tool)

## Key Features
- Payloads adapted dynamically to the detected OS (Linux or Windows)
- Simulated encryption logic and privilege-aware behavior (non-destructive)
- Designed for safe testing in isolated environments only
- Includes reverse payload for cleanup and control

## Contribution Details
This project was developed as part of a team-based capstone initiative. My individual contributions included:
- Writing the **OS detection logic**
- Developing the full **Linux-based ransomware simulation**
- Integrating and testing the Bash Bunny Ducky Script payload
- Documenting the lab setup, behavior flow, and simulation process

The **Windows-based payload** was developed by my project partner and is referenced in our joint capstone submission, but is not included here due to repository scope and platform specificity.

## Full Technical Write-Up

A complete 49-page case study of this capstone project is available for in-depth review. It covers:

- OS detection using Ducky Script
- Linux and Windows ransomware development
- Bash Bunny payload deployment
- Recovery mechanics and troubleshooting
- Ethical testing environments
- Full script breakdowns and test cases

## This project helped me:

- Build hands-on experience in malware behavior modeling and non-destructive offensive simulation
- Explore mitigation strategies and basic evasion techniques
- Conduct structured testing within isolated, virtual environments
