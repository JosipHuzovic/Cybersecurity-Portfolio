# Capstone: Malware Simulation & Response Planning

**Awarded 2nd Place** at the 2024 Mid-Hudson Valley TechMeet in the Cybersecurity category  
*Recognized for innovation, safe malware simulation, and technical execution.*

Designed and tested a simulated cross-platform ransomware payload to study malware behavior, endpoint defenses, and mitigation strategies in sandboxed environments utilizing the Bash Bunny Mark II.

This simulation was built solely for demonstrative and educational purposes, utilizing keyboard impersonation (via the Bash Bunny) to inject commands into host systems and initiate a ransomware-like state on both Linux and Windows platforms.

## Disclaimer

This project contains simulated malware payloads developed strictly for ethical, educational use within controlled lab environments. **Do not deploy outside of sandboxed test systems.**

For full legal and usage guidelines, please see the [Ethics & Lab Use Policy](./ETHICS.md).

## Technologies Used
- Python and PowerShell scripting
- Linux & Windows sandboxed VMs
- Bash Bunny Mark II (USB emulation tool)

---
## Key Features
- Payloads adapted dynamically to the detected OS (Linux or Windows)
- Simulated encryption logic and privilege-aware behavior (non-destructive)
- Designed for safe testing in isolated environments only
- Includes reverse payload for cleanup and control

---
## Contribution Details
This project was developed as part of a team-based capstone initiative. My individual contributions included:
- Writing the **OS detection logic**
- Developing the full **Linux-based ransomware simulation**
- Integrating and testing the Bash Bunny Ducky Script payload
- Documenting the lab setup, behavior flow, and simulation process

The **Windows-based payload** was developed by my project partner and is referenced in our joint capstone submission, but is not included here due to repository scope and platform specificity.
