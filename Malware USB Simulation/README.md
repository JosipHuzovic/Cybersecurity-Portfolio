# Capstone: Malware Simulation & Response Planning

Designed and tested a simulated cross-platform ransomware payload to study malware behavior, endpoint defenses, and mitigation strategies in sandboxed environments.

## Technologies Used
- Python and PowerShell scripting
- Linux & Windows sandboxed VMs
- Bash Bunny Mark II (USB emulation tool)

## Key Features
- Payloads adapted to OS type and executed differently on Linux vs. Windows
- Included privilege detection and simulated encryption logic (non-destructive)
- Reverse payload for cleanup and control

## Takeaways
- Gained experience in malware behavior modeling and safe testing practices
- Explored mitigation strategies, AV evasion basics, and response timing
