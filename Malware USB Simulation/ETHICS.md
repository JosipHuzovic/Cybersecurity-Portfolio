# Ethics & Lab Use Policy

## Educational Use Only
This repository is intended **strictly for educational and demonstrative purposes** in isolated lab environments. All scripts and payloads were developed and tested in virtual machines under controlled conditions. **No part of this project is intended for real-world deployment, unauthorized access, or malicious use.**

This project simulates malware behavior to:
- Study operating system detection and environment-aware payloads
- Demonstrate privilege-aware ransomware behavior
- Practice defensive response and recovery workflows

## Responsible Use Guidelines

By using or referencing this repository, you agree to:

1. Operate exclusively within lab environments that you own or are explicitly authorized to test.
2. Avoid testing on any live production systems, personal data, or third-party networks.
3. Review and understand the code before executing any script or payload.
4. Assume full responsibility for any misuse, damage, or legal consequences arising from inappropriate usage.

## Testing Safely
- Use virtual machines (e.g., Kali Linux, Windows Sandbox, etc)
- Disable network access during active payload execution unless required for specific simulation
- Only test on files and environments you are prepared to wipe or recover
- Maintain backups of all virtual disks before each test
- Log and document test results for learning purposes only

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of a **Cybersecurity Capstone** at **Marist University** and received **2nd Place at the 2024 Mid-Hudson Valley TechMeet** for its innovation, technical execution, and ethical handling of malware simulation.

The project is part of a larger learning initiative focused on threat emulation, secure lab design, and blue team response planning.
